There is also Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE) which is the repeated imaginal and real-world exposure to the trauma until it is no longer upsetting.\n\n2. Medications, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) is also effective for PTSD. Some people seek treatments that do not involve medications because of the side effects.</string>
